## What is this?

`burnt` is an open-source tool designed to shift Databricks cost management left. Instead of waiting for the monthly bill, `burnt` predicts the cost of **Jobs, DABs (Databricks Asset Bundles), and SQL Queries** before they run.

Industry benchmarks show that **cluster configuration drives 70% of Databricks spend**. Rather than solely relying on query-level SQL analysis, `burnt` focuses on the **Qubika Cost Multiplier Model**: analyzing cluster configuration, compute types, and historical workload data to project costs at scale.

### Core Capabilities

*   **Pre-Orchestration Estimates:** Parse `databricks.yml` and Job JSON to project minimum and maximum workload costs before deployment.
*   **Historical Baselines:** Cross-reference `system.lakeflow.jobs` and `system.billing.usage` to detect silent cost drift.
*   **Query-Level `EXPLAIN` Analytics:** For ad-hoc analytics, estimate SQL query costs utilizing Spark's `EXPLAIN COST` without touching the actual data.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/burnt
cd burnt
uv sync
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Pre-Orchestration Job Estimation (Coming Soon)
Estimate the cost of a Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB) before deploying:
```bash
uv run burnt estimate-job ./databricks.yml
```

### 2. SQL / PySpark Cost Estimation
Estimate an individual query or file using static or hybrid estimation:
```bash
uv run burnt estimate "SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) FROM orders GROUP BY 1"
uv run burnt estimate ./notebooks/daily_revenue.sql
```

### 3. Native Databricks Runtime Integration
If you are running `burnt` *inside* a Databricks notebook, it natively uses your active `SparkSession`—avoiding slow and expensive REST API roundtrips:
```python
import burnt
# Automatically detects current notebook and estimates the cost to run it
estimate = burnt.estimate_current_notebook()
burnt.display()
```

---

## Anti-Pattern Detection (burnt lint)

`burnt` automatically warns you about expensive patterns in your SQL/PySpark code via AST parsing:

```
⚠  cross_join             CROSS JOIN creates O(n×m) rows — use INNER JOIN with ON clause
⚠  order_by_no_limit      ORDER BY without LIMIT forces a global sort
✗  collect_without_limit  collect() without limit() can OOM the driver
```

---

## Dual-Mode Runtime

`burnt` automatically detects its execution context:

| Context | Backend | Auth |
|---------|---------|------|
| Inside Databricks notebook | **SparkBackend** | Auto (SparkSession) |
| External with DATABRICKS_HOST | **RestBackend** | OAuth/PAT via SDK |
| Offline / CLI | Static only | None |

```python
import burnt
# Auto-detects: in-cluster → SparkBackend, external → RestBackend, offline → static
backend = burnt.runtime.auto_backend()
```

---

## Architecture & Enterprise Readiness

`burnt` is built for enterprise Databricks environments:
*   **Dual-Mode Runtime:** Automatically switches between external REST execution (via PAT) and internal SparkSession execution based on `DATABRICKS_RUNTIME_VERSION`.
*   **Table Registry:** Supports customizable mapping for governance-restricted system table views (e.g., `governance.cost_management.v_billing_usage`).
*   **Hybrid Estimation Pipeline:** Blends static analysis (Offline), Delta Metadata, `EXPLAIN COST` plans, and Historical Fingerprinting.
*   **Total Cost of Ownership:** Calculates both Databricks DBU rates *and* underlying Cloud VM infrastructure costs (AWS/Azure/GCP).

## Roadmap

| Phase | Status | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1-3 | ✅ Done | Foundation, System Tables, EXPLAIN parser |
| 4 | 🔄 Active | Databricks-Native Runtime & Core Math Fixes |
| 5 | ⏳ Planned | Pre-Orchestration Job Cost Projection (DABs) |
| 6 | ⏳ Planned | Query-Level Estimation Wiring |

### What's Implemented

- **RuntimeBackend** — Dual-mode execution (SparkBackend + RestBackend with OAuth)
- **4-Tier Estimation Pipeline** — Static → Delta → EXPLAIN → Historical
- **Anti-pattern detection** — SQL/PySpark linting via AST
- **Static cost estimation** — Complexity-based heuristics
- **EXPLAIN COST parser** — Parses Spark plans into structured data
- **Delta metadata parser** — DESCRIBE DETAIL → table stats
- **Query fingerprinting** — SHA-256 normalization for history lookup
