## What is this?

`dburnrate` is an open-source tool designed to shift Databricks cost management left. Instead of waiting for the monthly bill, `dburnrate` predicts the cost of **Jobs, DABs (Databricks Asset Bundles), and SQL Queries** before they run.

Industry benchmarks show that **cluster configuration drives 70% of Databricks spend**. Rather than solely relying on query-level SQL analysis, `dburnrate` focuses on the **Qubika Cost Multiplier Model**: analyzing cluster configuration, compute types, and historical workload data to project costs at scale.

### Core Capabilities

*   **Pre-Orchestration Estimates:** Parse `databricks.yml` and Job JSON to project minimum and maximum workload costs before deployment.
*   **Historical Baselines:** Cross-reference `system.lakeflow.jobs` and `system.billing.usage` to detect silent cost drift.
*   **CI/CD Guardrails:** Block deployments if projected costs exceed Databricks Budgets or jump >20% week-over-week.
*   **Query-Level `EXPLAIN` Analytics:** For ad-hoc analytics, estimate SQL query costs utilizing Spark's `EXPLAIN COST` without touching the actual data.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/dburnrate
cd dburnrate
uv sync
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Pre-Orchestration Job Estimation (Coming Soon)
Estimate the cost of a Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB) before deploying:
```bash
uv run dburnrate estimate-job ./databricks.yml
```

### 2. SQL / PySpark Cost Estimation
Estimate an individual query or file offline using static heuristics:
```bash
uv run dburnrate estimate "SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) FROM orders GROUP BY 1"
uv run dburnrate estimate ./notebooks/daily_revenue.sql
```

### 3. Native Databricks Runtime Integration
If you are running `dburnrate` *inside* a Databricks notebook, it natively uses your active `SparkSession`—avoiding slow and expensive REST API roundtrips:
```python
import dburnrate
# Automatically detects current notebook and estimates the cost to run it
estimate = dburnrate.estimate_current_notebook()
dburnrate.display()
```

---

## Anti-Pattern Detection (dburnrate lint)

`dburnrate` automatically warns you about expensive patterns in your SQL/PySpark code via AST parsing:

```
⚠  cross_join             CROSS JOIN creates O(n×m) rows — use INNER JOIN with ON clause
⚠  order_by_no_limit      ORDER BY without LIMIT forces a global sort
✗  collect_without_limit  collect() without limit() can OOM the driver
```

---

## Architecture & Enterprise Readiness

`dburnrate` is built for enterprise Databricks environments:
*   **Dual-Mode Runtime:** Automatically switches between external REST execution (via PAT) and internal SparkSession execution based on `DATABRICKS_RUNTIME_VERSION`.
*   **Table Registry:** Supports customizable mapping for governance-restricted system table views (e.g., `governance.cost_management.v_billing_usage`).
*   **Hybrid Estimation Pipeline:** Blends static analysis (Offline), Delta Metadata, `EXPLAIN COST` plans, and Historical Fingerprinting.
*   **Total Cost of Ownership:** Calculates both Databricks DBU rates *and* underlying Cloud VM infrastructure costs (AWS/Azure/GCP).

## Contributing & Development

We use `uv` for fast package management.

```bash
uv run pytest -m unit -v          # 263 unit tests
uv run ruff check src/ tests/     # lint
uv run ruff format src/ tests/    # format
uv run bandit -c pyproject.toml -r src/  # security audit
```
